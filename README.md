- 👋 Hi, I’m @creativemindscapes
- 👀 I’m interested in graphic design, web development, and vr development, video gaming, and crafting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced coding in CSS while making the journey to become a Web Developer. As I am still in the beginning phases I have not decided to go Front End or Full-Stack although Full-stack seems eminent.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EVERYTHING! I've been in the computer industry for over 30 years and I love learning new things and teaching new things.
- 📫 How to reach me: the best ways to reach me are by email at creativemindscapes@gmail.com or creativemindscapes@icloud.com and we can go from there.
